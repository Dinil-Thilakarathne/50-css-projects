## Project Overview:
- [Source Code](https://github.com/Dinil-Thilakarathne/50-css-projects/tree/main/social%20media%20icons)
- [Live demo](https://dinil-thilakarathne.github.io/50-css-projects/social%20media%20icons)

The "Social Icons List with Hover Animation" project is a visually appealing web component that displays a list of social media icons with accompanying text. The icons include Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube. When the user hovers over an icon, it expands to reveal the corresponding social media platform's name. The animation is smooth and enhances the user experience, making it an engaging element for any web development project.

## How it works

- The project consists of a container, `social-icon-list`, that holds the social media icons.
- Each social media icon is represented by an `icon-group` element containing an icon and accompanying text.
- Initially, the icons are displayed with a fixed size and a border around them.
- When the user hovers over an icon, the `icon-group` expands in width and the text becomes visible.
- Additionally, a background circle, `icon-bg`, grows in size, creating an eye-catching animation effect.
- The animation and transition effects are achieved using CSS properties like `width`, `color`, and `clip-path`.
