## Project Overview:
- [Source Code](https://github.com/Dinil-Thilakarathne/50-css-projects/tree/main/model-popup)
- [Live demo](https://dinil-thilakarathne.github.io/50-css-projects/model-popup)

The project aims to create a creative and modern modal/popup using only HTML and CSS. The modal opens when the "Open Modal" button is clicked and displays a title, content, and a close button. The modal has a clean and elegant design, with a semi-transparent overlay and centered alignment. It provides a visually appealing and user-friendly way to present additional information or interactive elements without navigating away from the main page.

To use the modal in your project, include the HTML code and apply the provided CSS styles. Customize the content, colors, and dimensions to match your project's design and requirements. The modal can be used to display various types of content, such as images, forms, videos, or any other HTML elements.

The CSS code includes transitions and animations to provide smooth and visually appealing interactions. The modal fades in and slides up into view, while the overlay creates a dimmed background. The close button allows users to easily dismiss the modal.
