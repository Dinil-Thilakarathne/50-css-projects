## Project Overview:
- [Source Code](https://github.com/Dinil-Thilakarathne/50-css-projects/tree/main/animated%20loader)
- [Live demo](https://dinil-thilakarathne.github.io/50-css-projects/animated%20loader)

The project aims to create a creative and modern animated loader using HTML and CSS. The loader consists of a horizontal bar that gradually fills up to represent the loading progress. It provides a visually appealing and engaging way to indicate that content is being loaded or processed.

To use the loader in your project, include the HTML code and apply the provided CSS styles. Customize the dimensions, colors, and animation duration to match your project's design and requirements. You can adjust the width of the loader and the fill animation to suit your needs.

The CSS code includes styles for the loader container, loader bar, and the animation keyframes. The loader container is centered using flexbox and takes up the full viewport height. The loader bar has a background color and border radius to give it a stylish appearance. The fill animation is achieved using keyframes, gradually increasing the width of the bar from 0% to 100% over a 2-second duration.
