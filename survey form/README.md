## Project Overview:
- [Source Code](https://github.com/Dinil-Thilakarathne/50-css-projects/tree/main/survey%20form)
- [Live demo](https://dinil-thilakarathne.github.io/50-css-projects/survey%20form)

The project aims to create a creative and modern survey form using HTML and CSS. The form allows users to provide their name, email address, a message, and rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5. It provides a user-friendly and visually appealing way to collect feedback or gather information from users.

To use the survey form in your project, include the HTML code and apply the provided CSS styles. Customize the form fields, labels, colors, and dimensions to match your project's design and requirements. You can also add additional form fields or validation as needed.

The CSS code includes styles for form layout, input fields, labels, and the submit button. It provides a clean and responsive design, ensuring the form looks great on different screen sizes. The submit button has a contrasting color to draw attention and a hover effect for visual feedback.
